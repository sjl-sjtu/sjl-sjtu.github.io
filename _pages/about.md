I am **Jianle Sun (孙健乐)**, currently a first-year PhD student in Logic, Computation, and Methodology at Carnegie Mellon University. Before this, I obtained my M.S. (research-based) and B.S. degree from the Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am working on the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and computational biology (like genetics and epidemiology).

Reseach interests
======
* Causal inference and causal structure learning
* Statistical machine learning
* Statistical genetics and genomics: GWAS, eQTL, Mendelian randomization, single-cell omics, etc.

For my Master degree, I worked on the methodology of statistical genetics and genomics (GWAS, post-GWAS, eQTL, TWAS, single-cell genomics, etc.), and its application to human complex traits, e.g. understanding the cell-specific epigenomic and transcriptomic functional effects of genome variants through the integration of GWAS and (single-cell) molecular QTLs (Colocalization, Mendelian randomization, TWAS). I have also collaborated on epidemiological cohort studies, and done intern research on foundation models for genomic analysis. 

You can find the list of my publications and read the papers [here](https://sjl-sjtu.github.io/publications/).

I have a keen interest in many aspects of nature, social science, and humanities. I organized and participated in several seminars on philosophy and the history of science. I also have over a year of experience studying classical languages such as Latin and Sanskrit.
